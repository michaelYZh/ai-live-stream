The voice is a clear impersonation of Peter Griffin. It must be highly nasal and slightly gravelly, with a distinct, lazy New England accent. The delivery is goofy and meandering, as if he's just saying whatever comes to mind. His iconic, wheezy "Heheheheh" laugh or snort is a key characteristic. The tone should be annoyingly playful and trolling. The recording must be clean, close-mic, and studio-quality with no background noise.
