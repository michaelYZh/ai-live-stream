This is a strong impersonation of Spongebob Squarepants. The voice must be very high-pitched, slightly nasal, and full of bubbly, cheerful energy. The pitch should wobble and often crack with excitement. His iconic high-pitched, rapid giggle ("Ah-hah-hah-hah") is essential. The delivery is bouncy and eager, but always polite and innocent. The recording must be clean, close-mic, and studio-quality with no background noise.
