I walked into the kitchen and sat down at the table. I looked with a Grimace at the questionable meal Lois
had placed in front of me. Of course I'd never tell her how disgusted I was with her cooking, but somehow I think she knew.
Lois had always been full of energy and life, but lately I had begun to grow more aware of her aging. The bright exuberant
eyes that I had fallen in love with were now beginning to grow dull and listless with the long fatigue of a weary life.
